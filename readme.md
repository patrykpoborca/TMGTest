#TMG Test app

Made app to allow people to add and edit scores.

- Scores can be edited and added
- Settings allow you to delete cached data
- Some basic persistence (using shared pref)
- Leaderboards sorted by grouping games by player names. Can be sorted by win ratio, win total and games played

App is designed using MVVM where an event is triggered and reduced/transformed into an effect or state changes.
